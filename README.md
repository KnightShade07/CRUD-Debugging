# CRUD-Debugging
Debugging a Website with CRUD Functionality

This was a website riddled with bugs that I had to fix.

In this project, I gained more experience with:
- Debugging.
- Using Breakpoints.
- Google Searching.
- Auto Generating CRUD Pages using VS 2019's built in CRUD Features.
- Knowing how and when to use RedirectToAction instead of returning just a plain view.
- Solving SQLConccurency Exceptions with HTML.HiddenFor when you need to get the ID for something.
- Making sure that the auto generated asp-actions match up with what the views were actually called.
- Paying more attention to what is being passed in to variables during debugging.
